# KB Style Guide

## Philosophy
- Minimalist, capture-first experience
- Reduce friction - actions happen as you type
- Desktop-focused (mobile not a priority)

## Core UX

### Input (Hero Element)
- The input field is the most prominent element in the UI
- Should feel inviting and always ready

**Open question**: Submit behavior for multi-line content
- Options: Enter submits, Cmd+Enter submits, or keep subtle button + keyboard shortcut
- Need to balance friction-free capture with multi-line support

### Search
- Live/instant filtering as you type
- No search or clear buttons
- Results update immediately

## Visual Design

### Spacing
- Generous whitespace, avoid density
- Let elements breathe

### Color Palette
- Dark theme foundation
- Add warmth/joy - not somber or sad
- Sophisticated but not sterile

### Entry Cards
- Card-based display for entries
- **Ellipsis for long content** - no text walls
- Truncate gracefully, expand on interaction

### Tag Hierarchy
- Collapsible/foldable tree structure
- Allow users to focus on relevant branches

## Typography
- Keep it simple and readable
- Open to something slightly more distinctive than system defaults
- Consistency over novelty

## Motion & Animation
- Minimal and purposeful
- Subtle transitions where they add clarity
- No gratuitous animation
- Use judgment - less is more
